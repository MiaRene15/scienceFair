                    I created simulations via Virtual Reality for different negative
                    mental states including: stress, anxiousness, overwhelmed, and despondency. 
                    The simulations were created with the purpose of reducing and reversing the effects of those harmful states. 
                    Each simulation is around 5 to 6 minutes, has a serene and beautiful surrounding, 
                    features a calming guided meditation or excerise, and provides extensive research information.
