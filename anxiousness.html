  <!-- This entire section is the webpage you see before the simulation begins.
        I wanted to create an introduction or transition page to inform the users of my research, give proper credit, and give directions. 
        This transition page is on the same webpage as the simulation, because I wanted to make it easily accesible of all devices. 
        AFRAME, the company who created the AFRAME code, stated that apple devices would not hear sound without a "click event". 
        A "click event" is when a user clicks on a object and creates an action (or a series of actions). 
        I didn't want a click event to be in the simulation, because not all VR googles can click on things. 
        Ulitmately, I decided I would use the click event on the transition page to both start the simulation 
        and to adminster the proper sound for the simulation.-->

            Anxiousness is defined as focusing on the future or frightening possibilities. 
            The act of being present reduces anxiousness and increases positivity. 
            I believe a guided exercise focused on
            being present will bring individuals feeling anxiousness to a more positive mindset.

              <strong id="font_trebuchet">Background Research:</strong> 
              A Harvard University study showed that adults spend only 50% of their time
              focusing on the present.
              It also found that when individuals are fully present, they are at their happiest.
              Other research reveals that being present makes you more productive, charismatic, and happier.
